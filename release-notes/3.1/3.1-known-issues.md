# .NET Core 3.1  Known Issues

This document lists known issues for **.NET Core 3.1 Preview 1 and beyond releases** which may be encountered during usage.

## .NET Core

Visual Studio 16.4 Preview 2 may uninstall .NET Core 3.0 when installed with the .NET Core 3.1 SDK. We recommend you re-install or repair the [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0) if this happens.

### .NET Core installation on macOS Catalina (10.15)

macOS Catalina introduced new security features which affect the .NET Core installers. If you run the installer after downloading using a web browser, a warning dialog will open stating the package `"...can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."`, and the installation will be stopped.

To override this behavior, go to Settings : Security & Privacy and choose "Open Anyway" next to the dotnet installer text.

We are working to update our installers for the new Catalina requirements. These will be released during an upcoming monthly update.

## .NET Core 3.1 SDK, all releases

## ASP.NET Core

* **[RESOLVED] Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation package is missing MSBuild targets to correctly enable runtime compilation**

Due to an package authoring error, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation` is missing build targets that are required to for runtime compilation to work. 
Users of this package will see errors along the lines of `"System.InvalidOperationException: Cannot find reference assembly '...' file for package '...'*`

To resolve this issue, add the following contents to the your project file:

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <PreserveCompilationContext>true</PreserveCompilationContext>
    <PreserveCompilationReferences>true</PreserveCompilationReferences>
    <GenerateRazorHostingAssemblyInfo>true</GenerateRazorHostingAssemblyInfo>
    <RazorUpToDateReloadFileTypes>$(RazorUpToDateReloadFileTypes.Replace('.cshtml', ''))</RazorUpToDateReloadFileTypes>
    <AddCshtmlFilesToDotNetWatchList>false</AddCshtmlFilesToDotNetWatchList>
  </PropertyGroup>
```
This issue has been resolved in 3.1 Preview 2.
